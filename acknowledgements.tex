Aiichiro Nakano, 

I am fortunate to have many good friends and colleagues at ISI. Gideon Juve, Karan Vahi, Gaurang Mehta, Mats Rynge, Fabio Silva and Jens Vo Ìˆckler have all been wise counselors and great sources of ideas and discussion.

I am fortunate to meet Rafael at the last year of my Phd, who provided a sounded support of my research. And I would like to offer my special appreciation to Rafael for all of his work on the research described in Chapter. Rafael helped me finalize the algorithms and metrics used for balanced task clustering.
